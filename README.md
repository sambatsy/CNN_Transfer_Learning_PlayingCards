# Transfer_Learning_PlayingCards
#### PlayingCards image classification using transfer learning with a VGG-16 involves leveraging the power of pre-trained ResNet models for accurate classification of playing card images. By utilizing transfer learning, a pre-trained VGG-16 model, which has been trained on a large-scale dataset like ImageNet, serves as the foundation. The pre-trained VGG-16 model is then fine-tuned on a specific dataset of playing card images, allowing it to learn to recognize and classify different playing card types, suits, or other relevant attributes. This approach saves valuable time and computational resources by leveraging the learned representations from the pre-trained model. With the trained CNN model, accurate and efficient classification of playing card images can be achieved.
